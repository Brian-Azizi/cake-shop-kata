Connascent Cakes are an artisan baker who sell custom-made cakes for delivery.

They want to build a website for selling their cakes online and need you to write code that can calculate the delivery date for their cakes.

The "lead time" is the number of days that it takes to make a cake.

The earliest delivery date for a cake is the order date plus the lead time. For example, a cake ordered on the 1st of the month, with a 2 day lead time, will be delivered on the 3rd of the month.

Small cakes have a lead time of 2 days.
  * An order for a small cake, placed on Monday afternoon, has a delivery date of Wednesday 

Big cakes have a lead time of 3 days.
  * An order for a big cake, placed on Monday afternoon, has a delivery date of Thursday.
  
If a cake order is received in the morning (ie, before 12pm) then baking starts on the same day.
  * An order for a small cake, placed on Monday morning, has a delivery date of Tuesday

Custom frosting adds 2 days extra lead time.
  * An order for a small cake with custom frosting, received on Monday morning, has a delivery date of Thursday.
  
The baker only works Monday-Friday.
  * An order for a small cake received on Friday morning has a delivery date of Monday
  * An order for a small cake with frosting received on Friday morning has a delivery date of Wednesday
  
The froster works Tuesday-Saturday.
  * An order for a big cake with custom frosting received on Tuesday afternoon has a delivery date of Wednesday
  
Fancy boxes have a lead time of 3 days. Boxes can be ordered before cakes are baked.

  * An order for a big cake with a fancy box, placed on Monday morning, has a delivery date of Wednesday
  * An order for a big cake with a fancy box, placed on Monday afternoon, has a delivery date of Thursday
  
The shop is closed for Christmas from the 23rd of December and is open again on the 2nd of January.
Cakes that would be complete in that period will be unable to start production until re-opening.
